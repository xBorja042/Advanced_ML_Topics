# ADVANCED ML

This is a repository where I will upload results and experiments of more complicated DL architectures
as long as the computational power allow me to try them. Since many of them are related to image projects
they might not be possible to be visualize from github, so just copy the link into the nb viewer when
it is jupyter notebook format:

I hope you like them!
